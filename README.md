# Collaborative WebGIS Project

Welcome to the Collaborative WebGIS Project! This project is being developed as a learning initiative by apprentice members of the WebGIS Development Mastery course on Skool. Our goal is to build an interactive WebGIS application that allows users to visualize, analyze, and interact with geospatial data while honing our skills in web development and GIS technologies.
